## Special Cloudinary Stuff ðŸŒ¥ðŸŒ¥ðŸŒ¥

- Check out the `Video` component in `components/common/Video.js`.  It uses Cloudinary's `AdvancedVideo` component to automagically display a video based on the public id.
- Check out the `lib/cloudinary-tools.js` file - it has a bunch of methods for manipulating Cloudinary images.
- I bet you can make a ton of improvements on this - if you do, let me know (@joelvarty)
## Notes

### TypeScript

This starter supports [TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript) out of the box. If you would like to use TypeScript in your project, simply rename your files with a `.ts` extension to start taking advantage of Typescript concepts such as types and interfaces to help describe your data.


### How to Register Page Modules

1. To create a new Page Module, create a new React component within the `/components/agility-pageModules` directory.
2. All of the Page Modules that are being used within the site need to be imported into the `index` file within the `/components/agility-pageModules` directory and added to the `allModules` array:

```
import RichTextArea from "./RichTextArea";
import FeaturedPost from "./FeaturedPost";
import PostsListing from "./PostsListing";
import PostDetails from "./PostDetails";
import Heading from "./Heading";
import TextBlockWithImage from "./TextBlockWithImage";

const allModules = [
  { name: "TextBlockWithImage", module: TextBlockWithImage },
  { name: "Heading", module: Heading },
  { name: "FeaturedPost", module: FeaturedPost },
  { name: "PostsListing", module: PostsListing },
  { name: "PostDetails", module: PostDetails },
  { name: "RichTextArea", module: RichTextArea },
];
```

### How to Register Page Templates

1. To create a new Page Template, create a new React component within the `/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory.
2. All of the Page Template that are being used within the site need to be imported into the `index` file within the `/components/agility-pageTemplates` directory and added to the `allTemplates` array:

```
import MainTemplate from "./MainTemplate";

const allTemplates = [
  { name: "MainTemplate", template: MainTemplate }
];
```

### How to Preview Content

Since this is a static site, how can editors preview content in real-time as they are making edits within Agility CMS? Vercel supports Previews out of the box! Simply paste the address of your site deployed on Vercel into your Agility Sitemap Configuration (Settings > Sitemaps), and use it as your Preview Deployment.
